Given a FASTQ file f, please write a program to read sequences from f and find out the frequency
of all substrings with length k across all sequences in f.
The input parameters are
• Raw sequence data in FASTQ format f
• Length of the adaptor k
The output will be
• A sorted list with substrings according to their frequency in your sequence data
